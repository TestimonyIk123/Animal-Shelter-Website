  <h2><em>Meaning of an Animal Shelter</em></h2>
  <p>An <strong>animal shelter</strong> or <strong>pound</strong> is a place where stray, lost, abandoned or surrendered animals - mostly dogs and cats - are housed. While <strong>no-kill shelters </strong>exist, it is sometimes policy to euthanize animals that are not claimed quickly enough by a previous or new owner. In Europe, of the 30 countries included in a survey, all but five <span>(Austria, Czech Republic, Germany, Greece and Italy)</span> permitted euthanizing non-adopted animals. </p>
  <h2><em>Importance of Animal Shelters</em></h2>
  <p>Animal shelters play a vital role in our communities as they continuously work to reunite pets with their owners, shelter those in need and find new homes for animals that are lost,  without a permanent home or for those animals that, for our own security, shouldn’t be roaming our streets.  For animal shelter workers, it’s often a thankless job as they balance having enough space to house all the animals, coordinating pet adoptions and developing their homegrown campaigns to encourage people to be responsible and spay and neuter their animals.  And animal shelter staffs do all of this while trying to convince people to look first at animal shelters for that special family pet. <a href= "https://www.richellusa.com/the-importance-of-animal-shelters/"><strong>See more...</strong></a></p>
